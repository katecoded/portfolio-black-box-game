# Black Box Game

This program represents an abstract board game called Black Box. Black Box has a 10x10 board full of Atoms in certain locations, and the user guesses where the Atoms are based off of how Rays interact with them when shot from the border squares. Rays will deflect, reflect, hit, and miss Atoms depending on the placement of Atoms in the Black Box. The user will use this information in order to make guesses on where Atoms are on the board, and the goal is to do this by using the lowest amount of Rays possible. The user starts with a score of 25 points, and each incorrect guess will result in a 5 point deduction (though multiple incorrect guesses in the same location will not deduct more than 5 points). When shooting Rays, each use of an entry or exit location will result in a 1 point deduction per new entry and exit point.

Further information on how the game works can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Box_(game)). 

The program was written in **Python** as a portfolio project.
